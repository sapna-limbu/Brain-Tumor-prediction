# Brain-Tumor-prediction
Objective :
Develop predictive models to accurately classify brain tumor cases based on tumor-related features.

Constraints:
Ensure that the data for tumor-related features (Area, Perimeter, Convex Area, Solidity, Equivalent Diameter, Major Axis, Minor Axis) is accurate, reliable, and comprehensive to facilitate effective model training and evaluation.

Columns Overview:

	Unnamed 0: Index column
 
	Area: Area of the tumor detected in mm
 
	Perimeter: The perimeter of the tumor detected
 
	Convex Area: The area of the convex hull covering the tumor 
 
	Solidity: Solidity of the brain tissue. More solidity, higher the chance of having a tumor
 
	Equivalent Diameter: Diameter of the tumor
 
	Major axis, Minor axis : axis information required for finding the stage of the tumor
 
	Eccentricity: Elongation or roundness of the tumor indicating the severity/ aggressiveness
 
	Class: Target variable, 1- Tumor detected, 0- No tumor detected
